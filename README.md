## Installation

You need to have this installed locally and then invoke it with the command line. 

## Usage

The user opens the directory and makes sure that they have added their db name, mySQL user, and mySQL password to the env. This will allow them to connect ot a database using sequlzie, which they can then interact with via schema and seed commands. This seeds a newly created dev database that can be interacted with in Insomnia or Postman.
